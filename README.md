# Phrase Hunter
Created based on project from Teamtreehouse.com. 
HTML slightly altered, existing CSS code altered by adding media queries and enhancing flexbox layout to work on mobile devices. 
Javascript created by me. 
If you are also student and  working on this or a similar project, feel free to reach out to me with anyquestions about this code. I've made an effort to include helpful comments anddocumentation for fellow learners.

## Logo
![Phrase Hunter Logo](/images/SplashImage.png)

The 'Phrase Hunter' image is found in the repository as both a Scalable Vector Graphic and a PNG. In some cases, SVGs are smaller but in this case the complexity of the images makes the PNG a smaller sized option. 

Benefits of the SVG include:
* resizable without pixelation
* contains extra data like transparency and font information

Benefits of PNG the include
* often smaller file sizes for images with complex colors
* transparency in PNG-24 files

### The typefaces used in the logo were:
The 'Phrase' text on the logo is based on 'Sidecar' by Fenotype -> https://fenotype.com/. The 'Hunter' text is loosely based on DIN Condensed, an Adobe Font ->https://fonts.adobe.com/. The Neon effect was created in Adobe Illustrator.
