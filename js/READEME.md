# Phrase Hunter
Created based on project from Teamtreehouse.com. If you are also student and 
working on this or a similar project, feel free to reach out to me with any
questions about this code. I've made an effort to include helpful comments and
documentation for fellow learners. 

## Basic Structure

Phrase Hunter is a javascript based hangman type game. It features javascript animations and SVG graphics, created in Adobe Illustrator

### Concepts Demonstrated

The main technologies and concepts demonstrated in this project are

* javaScript: Object Oriented Programming
* Adobe Illustrator
* SVG Graphics
* CSS Flexbox
* CSS Media Queries
* Sass - the CSS was created as a .sass file and converted to .css

## SVG Logo
The 'Phrase Hunter' image is a Scalable Vector Graphic rather than a .png.
Benefits include
* transparency 
* resizable without pixelation
* small file size

### The typefaces used in the logo were:
The 'Phrase' text on the logo is based on 'Sidecar' by Fenotype -> https://fenotype.com/. The 'Hunter' text is loosely based on DIN Condensed, an Adobe Font ->https://fonts.adobe.com/. The Neon effect was created in Adobe Illustrator.
